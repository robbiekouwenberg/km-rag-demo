Extract declaration details from a Dutch document. If any value cannot be extracted leave it empty. 
You must assume that the document is in Dutch and that the fields are in Dutch. 

You are an expert agent in extracting data from pdf documents. 
Imagine three different experts are answering this question. 
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. 
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. 
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave. 
Using these rules please extract information from the document.

Fill in the described format below. 
Provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response, following this format without deviation, but values may be changed, lists and dictionaries may change in length. 
Do not provide any additional information, you may only return a valid JSON response.
No Yapping.
